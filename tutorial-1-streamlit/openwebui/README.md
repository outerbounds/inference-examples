# Open WebUI 

Launches a simple Open WebUI app using your provided OpenAI key. In the [App Config](./app-config.yaml) we assume that you've created a secret/resource integration on the Outerbounds UI called `open-ai-integration` that contains your `OPENAI_API_KEY`. 

Launch: `outerbounds app deploy --config-file ./app-config.yaml`
